Yes, you absolutely **can build a web-based proxy checker tool** that:

- Accepts a list of proxy credentials (IP:PORT or IP:PORT:USER:PASS)  
- Checks if each proxy works (i.e., can connect to the internet)  
- Fetches the **proxy's IP, country, region, and geolocation info**

---

## ‚úÖ High-Level Workflow

1. **Frontend Input** ‚Üí Users paste proxy lines  
2. **Backend Validation** ‚Üí Test if proxy connects and makes a successful request  
3. **Geo Lookup** ‚Üí Call a service like `ipapi`, `ipinfo.io`, or `ipgeolocation.io` using the proxy IP  
4. **Display Results** ‚Üí Working/Not Working, IP, Country, City, etc.

## üîç Best Code Stack for This (Other Than Laravel)

### ü•á **Node.js + Express + Puppeteer or Axios**
Highly suitable due to:
- **Native async support** (you‚Äôll deal with lots of network calls)
- Puppeteer + Proxy support for headless validation (e.g., if you want browser-level testing)
- Easy to use with `axios` or `got` and `tunnel` libraries for HTTP proxy testing

‚úÖ **Why it's great:**
- Lightweight and fast for I/O-bound tasks
- Easily deployable on platforms like Vercel, Railway, or even simple VPS
- Tons of NPM libraries for proxying, geolocation, and concurrency

| Task                  | Node.js                 | Python                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| HTTP proxy check      | `axios + https-proxy-agent` | `httpx`, `aiohttp`         |
| SOCKS proxy check     | `socks-proxy-agent`     | `PySocks`, `requests[socks]`|
| Geo IP lookup         | `ipinfo`, `ipapi`, `geoip-lite` | `ipinfo`, `geoip2`         |
| UI Framework          | React/Vue (frontend)    | HTMX, JS or React/Vue      |

## üåê Sample Stack Recommendation

If you want something simple, scalable, and modern:

### **Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind (to paste proxies, show output)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Proxy Check:** Axios with `https-proxy-agent`
- **Geo Lookup:** Use [ipinfo.io](mdc:https:/ipinfo.io) or [ipapi.co](mdc:https:/ipapi.co)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (Node backend)
